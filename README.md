# Home Connect Local

The **Home Connect Local** allows users to integrate their home appliances supporting the  [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/global) standard for Bosch and Siemens using direct communication over the local network.

## Install the Integration

1. Go to the HACS -> Custom Repositories and add this repository as a Custom Repository [See HACS Documentation for help](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)

2. Click the button bellow and click 'Download' to install the Integration:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=homeconnect_local_hass&owner=chris-mc1)

3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

To use this integration, you must first create a Home Connect account and connect your appliances.

## Setup

1. Use the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader) to download your Appliance profiles, select "openHAB" as target. The downloaded ZIP-file contains each Appliance encryption Key and feature descriptions
2. Click the button below or use "Add Integration" in Home Assistant and select "Home Connect Local".

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=homeconnect_ws)

3. Upload the downloaded Profile file.
4. Select the Appliance you want to setup.
5. When the initial connection to the Appliance fails, your asked to manually enter your Appliance IP-Address.
6. Repeat from Step 2 if you want to setup more than one Appliances.

### Configuration parameters

- Profile file: The Profile File you've downloaded with the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader)
- Select Appliance: Select the Appliance you want to setup
- Host / IP-Address: Manually enter your Appliance Hostname or IP-Address

## Connection handling

- The integration connects to each Appliance in a background task. If the Appliance is not reachable
  (switched off, offline, or refusing the connection e.g. with HTTP 503 like some hobs), the connection
  is retried with exponential backoff: 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, ... up to 300 s, with up to 20 % random jitter.
  The backoff is reset after a successful connection.
- The first failed attempt is logged as a warning with host and reason, further attempts only at debug
  level. A successful connection after failed attempts is logged at info level.
- When an established connection is lost, the integration reconnects with the same backoff.
  Entities stay available for up to 5 minutes while reconnecting.

## Host updates via discovery (zeroconf)

Appliances announce themselves via mDNS (`_homeconnect._tcp.local.`). For an already configured
Appliance, a discovered address replaces the configured host only if:

- the host wasn't entered manually (manually entered hosts are never changed),
- the configured host isn't among the announced addresses,
- the address is usable (not loopback, link-local, unspecified, multicast or reserved) and
- the Appliance accepts a TCP connection on that address (port 443 for TLS, 80 for AES Appliances).

Otherwise the configured host is kept and a warning is logged. This prevents stale mDNS records,
mDNS reflectors/repeaters between VLANs or other unroutable announcements from replacing a working
host. Every host change is logged at info level.

## Remove integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, no extra steps are required.

## Reporting Issues and Bugs

### Bug report requirements

- A full debug log of at least reloading the config entry and any actions leading to an error
- The [Diagnostics](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#download-diagnostics) of the Config Entry
- For reports relating to adding a new Appliance: the `*_DeviceDescription.xml` and `*_FeatureMapping.xml` files from the Profile File

### Enabling debug logging

Use one of these two methods enable debug logging:

- Through the UI:
    1. [Enable Debug logging](<https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting>) on the detail page of the integration
    2. Reload the config entry
    3. Perform the actions that lead to an error
    4. [Disable Debug logging](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#disable-debug-logging-and-download-logs) on the detail page of the integration

- OR -

- Through configuration.yaml:
    1. Add the following to your [configuration.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) file:

        ```yaml
        logger:
        logs:
            custom_components.homeconnect_ws: debug # Home Connect Local Integration
            homeconnect_ws: debug
            homeconnect_websocket: debug # Homeconnect websocket Python package
        ```

    2. Restart Home Assistant
    3. Perform the actions that lead to an error
    4. Click the button below or navigate to "Settings" -> "Logs".
